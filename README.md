# ticki-tacki-toei
My very first pyton project, Paste the code on any compiler and run it. This way you can play a simple tic-tac-toe by yourself.

# Project Description
This is my very first project using the Python language, I am trying to exercise the things that I learned in my self-learning journey,
I'm currently learning C++ on my community college and learning python alongside with it was really fun and enjoyable.
